When working with git, commit often. Keep a record of what you have done. verify you have the latest with pull. code test code. commit and push changes


Download a repository with git clone example url

type null filename.type will create an empty file

echo "words" > filename.type will make a file with that text

updating the repository you can use git add filename.type to stage one file or git add . to stage all new things

after doing this add a git commit -m "info of what you changed"

then to push you can type git push origin main. this will push to the branch main or whatever you choose to type.
